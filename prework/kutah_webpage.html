        <h1>Who is Kutah?</h1>
        <img src="mask.jpg" width="300" height="230" class="ileft"/>
        <p class="big"> Kutah is a Chicago native that has always worked in education. She was a Teach for America corp member 
        and taught 3rd-5th grade Diverse Learning (formerly known as Special Education) at an elementary school. 
        Diverse Learning classrooms reqire differentiation and this is frequently achieved with online educational 
        programs. While these programs were helpful, Kutah saw ways they could be improved. When Kutah decided to 
        stop being a teacher, she considered applying for roles at Edtech companies, but ultimately took the Case Manager
        position at a different elementary school. For the past 2 years, Kutah has been leading the Diverse Learning 
        department at her school. Working in education during a pandemic has illuminated 1) that Kutah does not enjoy working 
        for a school and 2) the importance of online educational programs. Kutah has joined Coding Temple with the goal 
        of abtaining a job in the EdTech industry.

        <p class="big">Kutah is the proud cat mom of Panic and Disco. She adopted them from the <a href ='https://anticruelty.org/' target='_blank'> 
            Anti Cruelty Society</a> in 2016. Disco is the queen of the house. She is very selective about who she will
            grace with her presence, but once you have earned her approval, she is a cuddly cat. Panic is a friend to 
            everyone she meets. She enjoys playing with wand toys.Follow them on <a href ='https://www.instagram.com/panic.disco.official/'target='_blank'>Instagram</a>.</p>
